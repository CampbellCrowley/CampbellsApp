Android App that mimics [my website]'s features plus some.

I'm hoping to support most if not all Android devices with acting as a browser with the same content as [my website]. The reason is I wish to add widgets and notifications for server events as well as provide a better interface for mobile devices.

Intended features:
- Stopwatch/Timer control and display
  - All features of website.
- PC Status control and view
  - Widgets
    - For pressing existing buttons,
    - Showing current power state.
  - Notifications
    - Power state changes,
    - Server restarts,
    - Other user uses feature (presses button, etc.).
- Student database viewer and editor
  - All features of website current and intended.
- User login and account management.
  - Allow users to login/create accounts
    - then request access
    - or via email invite with pre-determined permissions.
  - Allow admins to modify user accounts.
